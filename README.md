### Key Insights

- **The United States** had the highest number of total cases and deaths.
- **South Africa**â€™s death rate was higher during early waves compared to **China**.
- **China** shows slower case growth, possibly due to strict containment.
- Vaccination progress varied, with the **United States** leading early in rollout.
